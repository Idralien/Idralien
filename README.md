(Yes, that's a coding wizard... because programming is basically magic �♂️✨)

🚀 About Me
I'm a junior programmer with the enthusiasm of a kid in a candy store (if the candy was code)! �🍭

🔭 Currently focused on: Web Development, Python, C, and C++

🌱 Always eager to learn new things (currently diving into [insert latest tech you're learning])

⚡ Fun fact: I can probably break your code just by looking at it... but I promise I'll help fix it too!
